# cheezchooz

An example app created to talk about discriminated unions and runtime validation.

The code is meant for studying, but you can nonetheless play with it. Use:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to generate a JSON Schema file & transpile TypeScript source code
- `npm test` to run a unit test (purposefully failing)
